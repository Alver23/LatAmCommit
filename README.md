# LatAmCommit

Welcome to this OpenSource project, the main goal is to practice our Git and GitHub skills in a simple static website

Here everything will change, this repo is going to be in a certain way ***alive*** as more and more developers join and everyone colaborates. Code will evolve constantly. 

**Let the commits begin!**
